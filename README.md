# Binary Diagnostic Test

Functions for calculating the sample size for hypothesis tests that compare two Binary Diagnostic Tests (BDT). Specifically, the four functions are:

## ComputeCR.BDT()
Plot the confidence region for "sensitivity" and "1- specificity" of the Binary Diagnostic Test (BDT)

## ComputeSS.BDT.Phase2()
Compute the phase 2 sample size for evaluating the Binary Diagnostic Test (BDT)

## SimulatePower.BDT.Phase2()
Obtain the simulated power using the given sample size.

## ComputeSS.BDT.Phase3()
Compute the phase 3 sample size for comparing the Binary Diagnostic Tests (BDT)

See "example.pdf" for a demonstration on how to use them.

Theese functions are based on the book:
